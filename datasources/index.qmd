## The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF)

The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) (Swedish: RiksSvikt) is managed by Uppsala Clinical Research Center (UCR).

SwedeHF is a health quality and research registry that started in 2000 and became nationwide 2003. In 2021 31.5% of the prevalent heart failure population in Sweden were at some point registered in SwedeHF. Coverage is lower in primary care but few patients are seen exclusively in primary care and are therefore caught and registered in cardiology or internal medicine.

Up until April 2017 the only inclusion criterion was clinician-judged Heart Failure (HF). From April 2017 the inclusion criteria are ICD-10: I50.0, I50.1, I50.9, I42.0, I42.6, I42.7, I25.5, I11.0, I13.0, I13.2.

The new version of SwedeHF also entailed other differences, mainly how data is collected. Previously there were no restrictions of what visits could be registered. In the new SwedeHF an index visits (the first time a patient is registered into SwedeHF) is registered and thereafter a follow-up visit within 6 months and thereafter yearly follow-ups. The yearly follow-ups can be either out-patient visits, telephone contact or survey. Only the first visit can be a hospitalization, this means that the proportion of hospitalized patients have decreased since April 2017.
